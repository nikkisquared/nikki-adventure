History
=======
"Nikki's Awesome Adventure" is my first big (at the time) solo python project, done in May 2012. It's been almost wholly unaltered since I last left it in 2012, but I've edited it to remove obliviously uncomfortable jokes in the game. I've left the code structure unchanged, even a couple bugs I'm aware of. I don't want to invest myself into re-making a project I already got bored with, but I thought it'd be interesting to share as an example of an early splotch of creativity from myself. As well as some, I think, clever methods at getting around not knowing how to make an adventure game work in any way.
